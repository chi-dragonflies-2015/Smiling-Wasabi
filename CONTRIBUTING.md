### Pull Request Workflow

- Write Code
- Commit your code and write a [good commit message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
- Before pushing your branch ensure all tests are passing. Don't make a pull request with a branch that has failing tests
- Push your branch and changes to your Github repository
- Create a Pull Request to your cohort organization

### Code Review Workflow

- Another team mate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github
- You make the desired changes (using the [Pull Request Workflow](#pull-request-workflow))
- Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made
- Code reviewer merges pull request with master
